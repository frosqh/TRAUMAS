Introduction
===============

Objective
-------------

This script aims to provide a testing base for a set of module-based heuristics for the :math:`R|prec|C_{\max}` problem.

Conventions
-------------

This entire document is written in serif.

More over, every glossary term shall be a link to its definition and its first occurrence
be followed by an asterisk (:math:`^{\star}`).

Project Description
--------------------
This project should allow any user to compile data related to the performances and the runtime of heuristics solving the
:math:`R|prec|C_{\max}` problem.

To do so, three scripts are available to use.
Each one of them will be described in further sections.
